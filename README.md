# First-Week-Challenge
This is my First Week's Challenge Repo
=======
Following are the highlights of the project:



I refactored an existing webpage to make it meet a certain set of standards and implementations of new technologies and also made the code cleaner. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.

Following are the conspiciuous changes made to the different parts of this webpage:

1. The webpage meets accessibility standards,
2. Has semantical HTML elements,
3. The structure of the HTML elements are correctly and logically constructed,
4. It has accessible alt attributes, where deemed crucial for accessibility,
5. It follows logical and sequential order of heading attributes,
6. And has a concise and descriptive title.
